Keep The Lights On
~~~
You're doing well. Next we need to make sure we can "eep the lights onâ". You should build a Geo Energy Plant. This will provide you with some energy to power your economy. There are several types of energy plants that will be available to you as your knowledge. Each type has some drawbacks and benefits, but for a fledgling empire like yours, it's good just to get the juice moving.

Let me know when you've got that built, and I'll give you some Lapis Fruit Pies. They are a delicious pastry from our home world. I'm certain your people will enjoy them.
