Drinking Water
~~~
Food and energy are only two of the four basic resources you need to keep your empire running. It's time to get your citizens some fresh water to drink. Build a Water Purification Plant. It will produce the water needed to keep your empire on the upward trend.

I see that your planet has a good supply of about %s%% fresh water. If the Water Purification Plant isn't pulling enough water from the planet for you, then you might consider getting recycled water using a Water Reclamation Plant or creating your own water by breaking down and combining the components of various types of ore using a Water Production Plant. But that's a task for another day. For now get that Water Purification Plant built.

Let me know when that's done as there's still much to learn. To help you keep your construction moving along, I'll give you 100 units of rutile ore, which is a fine construction material.
