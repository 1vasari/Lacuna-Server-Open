Mines
~~~
That's three of the four main resources. Now we need to get you gathering some of the precious minerals on your planet. Once that's completed you'll be harvesting all the main resources you need to expand your empire to the farthest reaches of the Expanse. Build yourself a Mine so that you can begin harvesting the ore that this planet has to offer.

As always let me know when you're done. This time I'll give you 200 units of each resource so you can get a jump start on your next construction project.
