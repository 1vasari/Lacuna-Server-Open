Higher Learning
~~~
Now you're collecting all the precious resources we need to keep you moving in the right direction. The University is key for your continued expansion. Without it you won't be able to gain the knowledge necessary to expand your empire. Build a University so your scholars have a place to study. No building in your empire can ever be more than one level higher than your University, so make sure you keep upgrading it as needed.

Let me know when you're done as I've got something special planned for %s.
