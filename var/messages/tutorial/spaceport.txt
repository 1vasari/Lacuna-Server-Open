Space Port
~~~
It's time you started exploring something other than your own planet. If you're going to have the greatest empire in the Expanse you'll need to be able to see what else is out there. You should start by building a Space Port. From the Space Port you can launch exploratory probes and other ships you build.

There's more to do after this, so let us know when this is done and we'll get you the next step. Also, after you're done, I will send you some more resources to help you keep up your pace.
