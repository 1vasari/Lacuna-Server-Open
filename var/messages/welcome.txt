Welcome
~~~
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Tou Re Ell, diplomat for {Empire 1 Lacuna Expanse Corp}. We welcome %s to The Lacuna Expanse! We are the original inhabitants of the Expanse, but we are so happy to see it growing. 

Since you are new I'd like to offer you an arrangment to help get your empire started. In return for completing some simple tasks, I will assist you in building the necessary components to ensure your survival.

I'll assume you want my help. If that's true, your first task is to gather some information for me about your star system. Locate your planet in the star map and rename it. 

Regards,

Tou Re Ell
Lacuna Expanse Corp

Task: Rename your planet.
Reward: A free building.
