Welcome
~~~
Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Lacuna Expanse Corp and we welcome %s to The Lacuna Expanse! We are the original inhabitants of the Expanse, but we are so happy to see it growing. 

Since you are new to the expanse we'll give you a hint to get your empire started. Resources are going to be the key to your survival and growth, but before you start collecting resources you should explore the user interface. Take some time to check out the basic views and where you are in the Expanse. 

Send me a message by replying to this one so that we know you're done with exploring and I'll have further instruction to get your empire off the ground.

Regards,

Tou Re Ell
Lacuna Expanse Corp
