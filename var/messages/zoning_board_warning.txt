Number of Starter Colonies Exceeded
~~~
It has come to our attention that you have more than the allowed number of colonies in the starting area. This can not be allowed to continue, since we want to be sure new empires have an area to start off with.

Please address this so that you only have %s number of colonies in the starting areas.

TLE Zoning Board Enforcement Division
