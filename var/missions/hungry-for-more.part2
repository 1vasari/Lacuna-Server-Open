After the previous shipment of Denton Root, it seems our people want more...  You have no idea how delicious steamed Root is after a diet consisting of solely of dried algae wafers!

Please obtain for us 3000 units of beetle and 3000 of milk, and we'll send along a couple of our new scanners, useful for studying the surface of remote worlds.","max_university_level":"12"}
