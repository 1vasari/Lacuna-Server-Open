We have a need for the discreet disposal of a large amount of waste.  We don't have the time to build a scow ourselves, as we've spend a great deal of effort stockpiling energy resources such as Uraninite and Monzanite.  In hindsight, perhaps we should have planned better for disposal of the waste associated with refining those ores.  We offer you 40,000 units of each of these in exchange for the ship.","max_university_level":"20"}
