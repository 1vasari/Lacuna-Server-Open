I know audiences everywhere loved the action packed adventure flick, but it seemed too simple.  I need to get to deeper levels, and what better way than to tell a romantic love story against the backdrop of a great tragedy.  Of course I mean the loss of the cruise ship Gigantic, which ran into an asteroid in 9112.  They all thought the ship was the toughest around, so I'll need a big freighter.  You should send along some burgers and bread, too, for my crews.  After they're all done working for me, I'll send them over to your planet.  It's a diverse group, so maybe you can use them in your development ministry, spaceport, or even your embassy.  The movie business is a big business, too!  You'll get a share of the profits in Essentia.","mission_type":"trade","mission_objective":{"resources":{"burger":30000,"cheese":15000,"bread":30000},"ships":[{"stealth":0,"speed":1000,"hold_size":55000,"type":"freighter"}]},"max_university_level":"25","name":"The Big Picture pt 3"}
