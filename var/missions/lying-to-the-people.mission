We have lost our asteroid mining operation on a local asteroid due to another asteroid impact. Unfortunately, do to the fact that the asteroid was almost tapped the resources we would allocate to reclaim the asteroid would not even make up for the expenditures, but we do need an equivalent quantity of resources in order to complete the plans set out by our homeworld. If you could supply us with those resources we would gladly announce to the Expanse of your generosity as well as granting you a glyph from our repository and our last Excavating ship.","name":"Lying to the People","mission_objective":{"resources":{"bauxite":2500,"sulfur":2500,"gypsum":2500,"magnetite":2500,"rutile":2500}},"mission_reward":{"ships":[{"speed":3000,"hold_size":0,"type":"excavator","stealth":1}],"glyphs":["chromite"]},"network_19_headline":"Border Colony of Inner Swillovia requests assistance in recovering asteroid mining operation.","max_university_level":"10","mission_type":"trade"}
