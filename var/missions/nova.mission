Their latest research indicates the star is due to go nova within weeks -- and apparently they haven't been doing their starship maintenance, because their evacuation cruiser is no longer spaceworthy. As such, they desperately need a colony ship to escape a fiery death. A short-range one is fine, as they just intend to move out of the nova's destructive range and continue their studies on it. In exchange they can offer a level of university and a glyph they have found.","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"type":"short_range_colony_ship","stealth":0}]},"max_university_level":"10","name":"nova","mission_reward":{"plans":[{"classname":"Lacuna::DB::Result::Building::University","level":1,"extra_build_level":1}],"glyphs":["gold"]},"mission_type":"trade"}
