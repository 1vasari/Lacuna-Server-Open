Cestak Mul here, Agriculture Minister for Alquor.  Look, munching on beetles and drinking the milk of large grazing creatures is incredibly satisfying, but there is so much more out there!

(*belch*) Please send along 5000 units each of shakes, chips, burgers, pies, and cider.  Our research has declined a bit since our last meeting, so rather than sending a research vessel, I can send you a new cargo ship.
