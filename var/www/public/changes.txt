   - Mod: Most API calls now have the option of named arguments as well as supporting the existing scheme for backwards compatibility

   - Mod: Default ship names no longer have the level of the shipyard (e.g. Probe 25)

   - TODO: Need to add the ability to recall orbiting ships when you view 'orbiting' at that body.
   - TODO: If you have a probe at a star, you can now see all other 'orbiting' probes at that star
   - TODO: When viewing 'available' or 'unavailable' fleets to send to a body, default shows current planets ships, filter allows other planets to be selected.

 - Trade Ministry changes
   - Mod: Supply chains can now be set up to allied planets
