        }
     ],
    "status" : {...}
 }

The requested area can be no larger than 121 stars. Throws 1003 when the area is too large.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 x1

The top left x coord.

=head3 y1

The top left y coord.

=head3 x2

The bottom right x coord.

=head3 y2

The bottom right y coord.

=head3 z

The z axis. There's no secondary z coordinate because you can only pull from one z axis at a time.



=head2 get_stars_near_body ( session_id, body_id )

Returns a list of 121 stars near a body, on the same z axis as the body. The list returned is the same as C<get_stars>

Throws 1002 and anything C<get_stars> can throw.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 body_id

The unique id of a body.


=head2 get_star_by_body ( session_id, body_id )

Returns the details about a star.

 {
    "star" : {
        "name" : "Sol",
        "id" : "yyyy",
        "x" : -3,
        "y" : 4,

        "can_rename" : 1
    },
    "status" : {...}
 }

Throws 1002.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 body_id

The unique id for a body.



=head2 get_star_system ( session_id, star_id ) 

Returns an array of bodies and a hash about the star itself. The data structure looks like:

 {
    "star" : {
        "id" : "a0f7f6e5-c58e-4b9d-994b-5838c2feabe8",

        "can_rename" : 1
    },
    "bodies" : {
       "f9fe8bd3-bd09-4dc2-ba20-cf4e3b69e63a" : {
            "name" : "Mercury",
            "orbit" : 1,
            "image" : "p13",
            "minerals" : {
                "Gold" : 9239,

        }
    },
    "status" : {...}
 }

Throws 1002 and 1010.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 star_id

The unique id of the star you wish to retrieve system information for.



=head2 get_star_system_by_body ( session_id, body_id )

Returns the same output and throws the same errors as C<get_star_system>, but locates the system based upon a body_id rather than a star_id.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 body_id
