=head1 Space Port Methods

Space Port is accessible via the URL C</spaceport>.

The Space Port is where all the ships you build will be docked once they have been built from the L<Shipyard>. You can dock twice as many ships as the level of the Space Port.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.
