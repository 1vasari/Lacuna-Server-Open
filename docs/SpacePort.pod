=head1 Space Port Methods

Space Port is accessible via the URL C</spaceport>.

The Space Port is where all the ships you build will be docked once they have been built from the L<Shipyard>. You can dock twice as many ships as the level of the Space Port.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

This method is extended to include a list of docked ships.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

=head3 page_number

Defaults to page 1. Shows 25 at a time.


=head2 view_foreign_ships ( session_id, building_id, page_number )

Shows you all the foreign ships that are incoming. However, the list is filtered by the stealth of the ship vs the level of the SpacePort. The formula is:

 300 * SpacePort Level >= Ship Stealth

If your SpacePort exceeds the Ship's Stealth, then you'll see it incoming. Otherwise you won't.

    "ships" : [
        {
            "id" : "id-goes-here",
