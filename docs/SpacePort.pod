=head1 Space Port Methods

Space Port is accessible via the URL C</spaceport>.

The Space Port is where all the ships you build will be docked once they have been built from the L<Shipyard>. You can dock twice as many ships as the level of the Space Port.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

This method is extended to include a list of docked ships.

    "building" : { ... },
    "status" : { ... },
    "docked_ships" : {
        "probe" : 3,

=head2 send_probe ( session_id, from_body_id, to_star )

Dispatches a probe from one of the space ports on a planet to a star. It will automatically detect which space ports on the planet have probes, if any, and pick one of them to dispatch the probe.

Returns status:

 {
    "probe" : {

    },
    "status" : { get_status() }
 }

Throws 1002.
