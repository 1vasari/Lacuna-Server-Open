=head1 Space Port Methods

Space Port is accessible via the URL C</spaceport>.

The Space Port is where all the ships you build will be docked once they have been built from the L<Shipyard>.
You can dock twice as many ships as the level of the Space Port.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 target

Some of the Space Port methods allow ships to be sent to targets. This parameter is described here.

A hash reference that can contain one of five items to identify a star or body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "star_name" : "Sol" }
 
 { "star_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head4 body_name

A string with the body's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 body_id

The unique id of the body.

=head4 star_name

A string with the star's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 star_id

The unique id of the star.

=head4 x | y

A set of x,y coordinates to locate the star or body.

=head2 paging

Some of the Space Port methods allow the results to be paged. This parameter is described here.

=head3 paging

Optional. A hash reference that contains the paging criteria. Valid paging option keys include page_number, items_per page and no_paging.

=head4 page_number

Optional. An integer representing the page of ships to return. Defaults to 1.

=head4 items_per_page

Optional. An integer representing the number of items per page to return. Defaults to 25.

=head4 no_paging

Optional. If set to 1, all other paging options are ignored and all results will be retured.

  { "no_paging" : 1 }

  { "page_number" : 2, "items_per_page" : 30 }

=head2 filter

Optional. A hash reference that contains the filter criteria. Valid filter option keys include task, type and tag.

=head3 task

Optional. An array reference or string with the task(s) to filter on. Valid tasks include Docked, Building,
Mining, Travelling, Defend, Orbiting, 'Waiting On Trade', 'Supply Chain' and 'Waste Chain'.

=head3 type

Optional. An array reference or string with the type(s) to filter on. Valid types are the existing ship types.

=head3 tag

Optional. An array reference or string with the tag(s) to filter on. Valid tags include Trade, Colonization,
Intelligence, Exploration, War, Mining, SupplyChain WasteChain.

Note: Tags will be converted to types prior to filtering and any types that were passed will be replaced.

  { "task" : "Defend" }

  { "tag" : "Mining" }

  { "task" : "Docked", "type" : "freighter" }

  { "tag" : [ "Colonization", "Exploration" ], "task" : "Travelling" }

=head2 sort

Optional. A string with the column to sort on. Defaults to 'type'. 

Valid columns to sort on are combat, name, speed, stealth, task and type.

A second sort colomn, 'name', is added to your chosen sort column (unless it happened to also be 'name')

B<association> in the B<from> section specifies either 'Own', 'Allied" or "Foreign" depending upon
who the fleet is from.

You will only see 'foreign' ships if the target is one of your own, or an allies planet, and then
the fleet information will be filtered depending upon the highest level of Spaceport on the target.

To see the C<from> block :-

 SpacePort Level * 450 >= Fleet Stealth

To see the C<details> block  :-

 SpacePort level * 350 >= Fleet Stealth

Note that you will always see full info for your own, or allied incoming ships.

The C<unavailable> block tells you about ships that are docked, but are for some reason not available to be used. The C<orbiting> block will be returned only if the target is body and tells you about fighters that are defending and can be recalled. The C<mining_platforms> block will be returned only if the target is an asteroid that has platforms on it. The value of C<fleet_send_limit> tells you how many ships can be included in a fleet.

 }

=head3 session_id

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "star_name" : "Sol" }
 
 { "star_id" : "id-goes-here" }

Throws 1002,1009,1010,1019

=head4 session_id

A session ID.

=head4 from_body_id

The Unique ID of the body that should send the ships

=head4 target

A hash reference that can contain one of five items to identify a star or body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }

 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }

 { "star_name" : "Sol" }

 { "star_id" : "id-goes-here" }

 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head4 star_id

The unique id of the star.

=head4 x | y

A set of x,y coordinates to locate the star or body.

=head4 types

An array reference that contains the specification of the ships to send and the quantity.

  [
    {
      "type" : "sweeper",
      "speed" : 10166,
      "stealth" : 10948,
      "combat" : 33372,
      "quantity" : 100
    },

  }
or
  {
    "earliest" : 1,
  }

So long as the sending body has that quantity of ships with those specifications, then the
ships will be sent.

Ships will be set to arrive at the B<arrival> time and date, which can be up to 60 days in
the future. B<day> is the day of the month, either the remainder of the current month, or
the start of next month. e.g. if the current date is 23rd of January, then a B<day> of 23
will refer to today whereas 3 would refer to 3rd of February.

If an arrival time is set which is prior to the earliest arrival time of the slowest ship,
then an exception is raised.

If earliest is set, all other values are ignored and ships are sent at fastest speed possible.
They may still be grouped together by the server into an attack group.
