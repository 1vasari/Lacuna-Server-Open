 }
 
=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

The unique id of the genetics lab.




=head2 run_experiment ( session_id, building_id, spy_id, affinity )

Allows you to experiment on prisoners attempting to graft their genetic traits onto your own species.

 {
    "experiment" : {
        "graft" : 1,        # did the graft succeed
        "survive" : 0,      # did the prisoner survive
        "message" : "The graft was a success, and the prisoner did not survive the experiment."
    },
    # the rest is the same as prepare_experiment 
 }

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

The unique id of the genetics lab.
