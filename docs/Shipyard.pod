=head1 Ship Descriptions

Ship descriptions are bulky, and are the same every time. As such we've created a file you can download to include ship descriptions in your client. You should cache this file once you've downloaded and only get it again if it has changed.

=head1 Shipyard Methods

Shipyard is accessible via the URL C</shipyard>.

The shipyard is where you build ships. However, you'll need other building types to enable the different kinds of ships that are available. The higher the level of the shipyard, faster your ships will be built.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.
