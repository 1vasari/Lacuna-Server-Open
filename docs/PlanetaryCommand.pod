=head1 Planetary Command Methods

Planetary Command Center is accessible via the URL C</planetarycommand>.

The Planetary Command Center (PCC), or just Command, is the hub of your empire on a planet. It gives you the resources and storage you need to get a foothold on a planet.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

Command extends the view method to include a C<planet> section.
