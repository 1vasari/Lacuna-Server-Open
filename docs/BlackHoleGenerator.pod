Black Hole Generator is accessible via the URL C</blackholegenerator>.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

This method is extended to include the list of tasks.

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "building" : { ... },
    "tasks" : [
       {
          "fail_chance" : 15,  #Note, range is not factored in.
          "min_level" : 10,
          "name" : "Make Asteroid",
          "occupied" : 0,
          "recovery" : 129600,
          "side_chance" : 10,
          "types" : [
             "habitable planet",
             "gas giant"
          ],
          "waste_cost" : 50000000
          "reason" : "You can only make an asteroid from a planet."
       },...
    ]
 }


=head2 generate_singularity ( session_id, building_id, target, task_name, [ params ] )

Returns success, failure, and side effect results.

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "fail" : { ... },
    "side" : { ... },
    "target" : {
        "class" : "Lacuna::DB::Result::Map::Body::Asteroid::A2",
        "id" : "body id",
        "name" : "name of planet effected",
        "old_class" : "Lacuna::DB::Result::Map::Body::Planet::P9",
        "old_size" : Size before change,
        "message" : "Made Asteroid",
        "size" : Size of body after effect
        "type" : "asteroid", "gas giant", "habitable planet", or "space station"
        "variance" : -1, 0, or 1
        "waste" : "Zero", "Random", or "Filled"
    }
 }

Not all fields are used for every result or task.

Throws 1002, 1009, 1010, 1013

Failure rates for the Blackhole Generator increases with range.

Side Effects happen fairly random, but occur more often the more difficult the task.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

The unique id of your Black Hole Generator.

=head3 target

A hash reference that can contain one of three items to identify a body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head4 body_name

A string with the body's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 body_id

The unique id of the body.

=head4 x | y

A set of x,y coordinates to locate the star or body.


=head3 task_name

=over

=item Make Asteroid

Can convert any non-inhabited planet to a random asteroid.  Initial size is determined by level of BHG. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 10.

=item Make Planet

Can convert any non-inhabited asteroid (no platforms) to a size 30 planet of random type.  Usable at Black Hole Generator level 15.

=item Increase Size

Can increase the size of a habitable planet up to size 65 or an asteroid up to size 10. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 20.

=item Change Type

Can change the type of a habitable planet to any of the basic 20 types. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 25.

=back

=head3 params

Optional hash reference only used for Change Type that looks like this:

  { "newtype" : 20 }

=cut
