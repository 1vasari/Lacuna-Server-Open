 ( parameter_hash )

Throws 1002, 1009, 1010, 1013

=head3 session_id (required)

Throws 1002, 1009, 1010, 1013

=head3 session_id (required)

A session ID

=head3 building_id (required)

This buildings ID

=head3 target (required)

A hash reference that can contain one of three items to identify a body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head4 body_name

A string with the body's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 body_id

The unique id of the body.

=head4 x | y

A set of x,y coordinates to locate the star or body.


=head3 task_name (required)

The Task that the BHG is to perform. One of.

=over

=item Make Asteroid

Can convert any non-inhabited planet to a random asteroid.  Initial size is determined by level of BHG. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 10.

=item Make Planet

Can convert any non-inhabited asteroid (no platforms) to a size 30 planet of random type.  Usable at Black Hole Generator level 15.

=item Increase Size

Can increase the size of a habitable planet up to size 65 or an asteroid up to size 10. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 20.

=item Change Type

Can change the type of a habitable planet to any of the basic 20 types. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 25.

Only allowed to change occupied planets that share your alliance.

=item Swap Places

Can swap places with another body within range. Usable at Black Hole Generator level 30.

=back

=head3 params (only required for C<Change Type>)

  { "newtype" : 20 }

=head3 RESPONSE

Returns success, failure, and side effect results.

 {
  "status" : { ... },
  "fail" : { ... },
  "side" : { ... },
  "target" : {
    "class" : "Lacuna::DB::Result::Map::Body::Asteroid::A2",
    "id" : "body id",
    "name" : "name of planet effected",
    "old_class" : "Lacuna::DB::Result::Map::Body::Planet::P9",
    "old_size" : Size before change,
    "message" : "Made Asteroid",
    "size" : Size of body after effect
    "type" : "asteroid", "gas giant", "habitable planet", or "space station"
    "variance" : -1, 0, or 1
    "waste" : "Zero", "Random", or "Filled"
  }
 }

Not all fields are used for every result or task.

Failure rates for the Blackhole Generator increases with range.

Side Effects happen fairly randomly, but occur more often the more difficult the task.
