The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

 This method is extended to include the list of tasks.

    "building" : { ... },
    "tasks" : [
       {
          "fail_chance" : 15,  #Note, range is not factored in.

        "old_size" : Size before change,
        "message" : "Made Asteroid",
        "size" : Size of body after effect
        "type" : "asteroid", "gas giant", "habitable planet", or "space station"
        "variance" : -1, 0, or 1
        "waste" : "Zero", "Random", or "Filled"
    }
 }

Not all fields are used for every result or task.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

The unique id of your Black Hole Generator.

=head3 target

A hash reference that can contain one of three items to identify a body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head3 task_name

One of the tasks available for the BHG.
Make Asteroid
Make Planet
Increase Size
Change Type

=head3 params
reference to a hash
Current usuage: $params = { newtype => 20 }
Only used for Change Type

=head3
Returns success, failure, and side effect results.

Throws 1002, 1009, 1010, 1013

=head3 Tasks

=over

=item Make Asteroid

Can convert any non-inhabited planet to a random asteroid.  Initial size is determined by level of BHG.
  Minimum Level of 10 to use this function.

=item Make Planet

Can convert any non-inhabited asteroid (no platforms) to a random planet.  Initial size is determined by level of BHG.
  Minimum Level of 15 to use this function.

=item Increase Size

Can increase the size of a habitable planet up to size 65 or an asteroid up to size 10.
  Minimum Level of 20 to use this function.

=item Change Type

Can change the type of a habitable planet to any of the basic 20 types.
  Minimum Level of 25 to use this function.

=back

  Failure rates for the Blackhole Generator increases with range.
  Side Effects happen fairly random, but occur more often the more difficult the task.

=cut
