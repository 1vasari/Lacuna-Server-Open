Politics Training Facility is accessible via the URL C</politicstraining>.

The Politics Training Facility is where you train your spies in the dark art of social engineering.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "building" : { ... },
    "spies" : {
        "maximum" : 5,
        "current" : 1,
        "in_training" : 1,
        "training_costs" : {
            "food" : 100,
            "water" : 120,
            "energy" : 20,
            "ore" : 5,
            "waste" : 10,
            "time" : [
                {
                    "spy_id" : "1",
                    "time" : "18720",
                },
                ...
            ],
        }
    },
 }
 

The list of spies available to train shows up under training_costs in the time section since that varies from spy to spy. 

=head2 train_spy ( session_id, building_id, spy_id )

Allows you to train an idle spy in the dark art of social engineering.

The trained spy will receive 1 politics per level of the building.

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "trained" : 1,
    "not_trained" : 0
 }
 
The only reason C<not_trained> might be over 0 is if you specify training more spies than you have resources to spend.

Throws 1013, 1009.
